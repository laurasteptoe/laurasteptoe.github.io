          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm a 2nd year student at the University of Southampton who has been programming for the past 5 years. I have worked on a number of my own games projects during that time, many of which have been lost along the way :( More recently i've been working with OpenGL and experimenting with different graphics techniques. <br><br>I've got a strange interest in very low level programming and game engine design so i end up designing things from the ground up. I know... I need to sort that out!<br><br>Hardware design has also had a part in my work (check out my single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYNmuYpib3Q">youtube video</a>!) so i enjoy programming microproccesors in assembly and C as well as my own simulated cpu from youtube in logisim :D</p>
